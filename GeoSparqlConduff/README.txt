GeoSparqlViz

This web application was originally developed by David Mattli using an earlier version of Django.  Colin Conduff updated the application for use with Django 1.8.5.

The app can be found at http://usgs-ybother.srv.mst.edu/viz

The web application allows users to write a sparql query and visualize the geospatial data returned from the query as a map layer, as well as tabular data.
